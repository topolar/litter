# Litter Frontend
Production version is available at https://litter-frontend.vercel.app

I made this app in NextJS + Prisma + GraphQL + React. 
Unfortunately I found right now, that you wanted to use NestJS, no NextJS... 
I did not read it correctly :-(. I tried some basic stuff in NestJS few
months ago, but I would need few weeks to learn it in detail.

## Frontend Requirements
- [x] Display a simple list of all posts, allow deleting each post
- [x] Create a detail page of one particular post
- [x] Create form to add a post to the list

## General Requirements
- Submit a git repository with the solution
- Ideally use these technologies: NestJS, Prisma, GraphQL, React
- No authentication & authorization is needed
- Appearance of the application is not important, you can take inspiration from any
  existing social network

## Additional Implementation
- [x] Support for Sign-in by Firebase Authentification / Google Sign-in
- [x] Server Side Rendering

## Development
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run codegen` - Generate GraphQL helper

## Deployment
Deployment is done automatically to Vercel by making push to GIT MASTER.
