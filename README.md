# Litter Social 

I made this app in NextJS + React and Express + Apollo + Prisma + GraphQL.
Then, I found, that you request to use NestJS, no NextJS...
I did not read it correctly ðŸ¤¦. So I made also the NestJS Backend. 

NestJS implementation is based on same Schema and same 
behaviour to keep it compatible with frontend and Apollo/Express backend.

## General Requirements
- [x] Submit a git repository with the solution
- [x] Ideally use these technologies: NestJS, Prisma, GraphQL, React
- No authentication & authorization is needed
- Appearance of the application is not important, you can take inspiration from any
  existing social network

# Implementation 
- [Frontend Documentation](frontend/README.md)
- [NestJS Backend Documentation](backend-nest/README.md)
- [Express/Apollo Backend Documentation](backend/README.md)
